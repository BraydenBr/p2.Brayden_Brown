Include the general information in your sketch: personalized calendar, news feed, text messages, social feed items, clock, and weather.

Include the health-related information in your sketch: sleep, weight, exercises, and mirror time

I chose a simple design where each option has a button on the left hand side to start. These buttons are customizable and can be moved or their size can change. I wanted to maximize the amount of mirror space so once a button has been pressed it can be pressed again to hide the information it presented.

<br /><br />**To get a B, you need to:**
<br />* Implement your Sketch in Processing or p5.js

Implement the general information : personalized calendar (from a csv or json file), news feed (from a csv or json file), current clock, and local weather (from a file or api).
I implemented personalized calendar, news feed with json file, local weather with api, and clock 

Implement the health-related information in your sketch (select one of these): sleep, weight, exercises, and mirror time (from a csv or json file).
I implemented the weight with a json file

Each button has a box in the code and a boolean value for being visible/invisible. When a button is pressed it displays information from the json file or api and when it it pressed again it removes the information. The buttons can be dragged to a different location and can also be resized.


<br /><br />
**To get a A, you need to:**
<br />Implement one of the advanced features
I implemented drag and drop and resizing (custumize screen)
The program can tell that when your mouse is hovering over a button whether it is over the resize edge or not. If it is on the resize then the button stays in place and gets bigger/smaller or else the button moves along with your mouse until you release the click

Provide your github report page and 2-minute presentation video
