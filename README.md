<br />* Provide the Sketch of your interface

Include the general information in your sketch: personalized calendar, news feed, text messages, social feed items, clock, and weather.

Include the health-related information in your sketch: sleep, weight, exercises, and mirror time

<br /> It is good because it is a simple design. Each button has a specific place that does not seem out of place.
<br />It is bad because you have the alarm right under the floor buttons and a whole button slot is taken up for a light

<br /><br />**To get a B, you need to:**
<br />* You use an elevator to go up floors by pressing buttons. Sometimes we use an elevator to haul large things that we can not bring up with stairs.
Having good button placement is key because it helps users who are in a hurry from pressing the wrong button.

<br />* The most common sequence is once you get into an elevator you push your floor button and sometimes press the close door button.
<br />* The elevator supports the user by displaying numbers on the buttons indicating floor level and using the start button symbolos for the door and alarm
<br />* Elevators typically provide feedback to the user by changing the color of a button when pressed

<br /> My design also features a foor pedal for those who cant use their hands at the moment
